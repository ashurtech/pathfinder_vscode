# 🎉 Environment Groups Feature - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Feature Overview

The **Environment Groups** feature has been successfully implemented for the Pathfinder - OpenAPI Explorer extension. This feature allows users to:

- **Create and manage environment groups** with color-coded visual distinction
- **Drag and drop environments** between groups and to/from root level
- **Enforce schema constraints** for group members 
- **Generate multi-environment code** for all environments in a group
- **Organize environments hierarchically** with better visual structure

---

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Environment Groups Management**
- ✅ Create new groups with customizable names, descriptions, and colors
- ✅ Edit existing group settings
- ✅ Delete groups (with confirmation)
- ✅ Color-coded group icons (blue, green, orange, purple, red, yellow)
- ✅ Theme-aware visual design

### 2. **Drag & Drop Functionality**
- ✅ Drag environments into groups
- ✅ Drag environments out of groups to root level
- ✅ Visual feedback during drag operations
- ✅ Schema compatibility warnings when moving environments

### 3. **Schema Constraint Enforcement**
- ✅ Groups can enforce shared schemas for all members
- ✅ Warning dialogs when adding incompatible environments
- ✅ Validation of schema compatibility during drag operations
- ✅ User choice to proceed or cancel on conflicts

### 4. **Multi-Environment Code Generation**
- ✅ Generate commands for all environments in a group
- ✅ Support for multiple formats (cURL, Python, PowerShell, etc.)
- ✅ Batch operations across group members
- ✅ Format selection dialog

### 5. **Hierarchical Tree Structure**
- ✅ Groups appear as top-level items
- ✅ Ungrouped environments appear at root level
- ✅ Group actions (add, edit, generate code)
- ✅ Environment actions under each group member
