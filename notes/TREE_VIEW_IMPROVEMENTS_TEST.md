# 🌳 New Tree View Features Test

## What's New

The tree view has been significantly improved! Instead of showing all endpoint details when you click, endpoints now expand to reveal action options.

## How to Test

1. **Start the Extension Development Host**
   ```
   Press F5 in VS Code
   ```

2. **Create a Test Environment**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type "API Helper: Add API Environment"
   - Create an environment (e.g., "Test Kibana")

3. **Load the Kibana Schema**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type "API Helper: Load Schema from File"
   - Select the Kibana schema: `sample-schemas/kibana-openapi-source.json`

4. **Test the New Tree View**
   - Open the Explorer panel
   - Look for "API Environments" section
   - Expand your environment → schema → tag groups
   - **Click on any endpoint** (🔗) - it should expand instead of showing details immediately

5. **Test the New Actions**
   When you expand an endpoint, you should see:
   - 📋 View Full Details
   - 💻 Generate cURL
   - 🔧 Generate Ansible  
   - ⚡ Generate PowerShell
   - 🐍 Generate Python
   - 📜 Generate JavaScript
   - 🧪 Test Endpoint

6. **Test Code Generation**
   - Click on any of the "Generate" actions
   - It should open a new file with the appropriate code
   - Each format should generate properly formatted code for that language

## Expected Behavior

### Before (Old Way):
- Click endpoint → Shows full details immediately in markdown

### After (New Way):  
- Click endpoint → Expands to show action menu
- Click action → Performs specific action (generate code, view details, etc.)

## Success Criteria

✅ Endpoints expand when clicked (don't show details immediately)
✅ Action menu appears with 7 options
✅ "View Full Details" shows the markdown documentation
✅ Code generation creates properly formatted files
✅ Different code formats work (cURL, Ansible, PowerShell, Python, JS)
✅ Test endpoint shows a dialog

This provides a much better user experience - less overwhelming, more organized!
