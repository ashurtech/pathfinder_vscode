# Test Guide: Kibana Enhancements & Tree View Improvements

## Overview
This guide tests the enhanced tree view experience and Kibana-specific code generation improvements.

## What We've Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Tree View Structure** ‚úÖ
- **Before**: Clicking endpoints showed full details immediately
- **After**: Endpoints are expandable with action menu options

### 2. **Endpoint Action Menu** ‚úÖ
Each endpoint now shows 7 action options:
- üìã **View Full Details** - Shows detailed endpoint information
- üíª **Generate cURL** - Creates cURL command with Kibana optimizations  
- üîß **Generate Ansible** - Creates Ansible task with proper headers
- ‚ö° **Generate PowerShell** - Creates PowerShell script with enhanced error handling
- üêç **Generate Python** - Creates Python requests code
- üìú **Generate JavaScript** - Creates JavaScript fetch code
- üß™ **Test Endpoint** - Placeholder for future HTTP testing

### 3. **Kibana-Specific Enhancements** ‚úÖ
All code generators now detect Kibana environments and include:
- **`kbn-xsrf: true` header** - Required for CSRF protection
- **Proper API key format** - Uses `Authorization: ApiKey <key>` instead of custom headers
- **SSL certificate handling** - PowerShell includes self-signed cert options
- **Enhanced error handling** - Especially in PowerShell with detailed error responses

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Launch Extension Development Host
1. Open VS Code in the extension folder
2. Press `F5` or Run ‚Üí Start Debugging
3. This opens a new Extension Development Host window

### Step 2: Load a Schema
1. In the Extension Development Host, open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type "API Helper: Load Schema"
3. Choose to load from file: `sample-schemas/kibana-openapi-source.json`

### Step 3: Test Tree View Structure
1. Open the **API Helper** view in the Explorer panel
2. Expand your loaded schema
3. **Verify**: Endpoints should now show with a collapsed arrow (‚ñ∂) instead of immediately showing details
4. Click the arrow to expand an endpoint
5. **Expected**: You should see 7 action options under each endpoint

### Step 4: Test Action Options
Try each action option for a sample endpoint:

#### 4a. View Full Details
- Click "üìã View Full Details"
- **Expected**: Opens a markdown document with endpoint details

#### 4b. Generate cURL (Kibana-Enhanced)
- Click "üíª Generate cURL"
- **Expected**: Opens a shell script with:
  - `curl -X METHOD "URL"`
  - `Authorization: ApiKey <key>` (if Kibana environment)
  - `kbn-xsrf: true` header (if Kibana environment)
  - Proper formatting with line continuations

#### 4c. Generate PowerShell (Kibana-Enhanced)
- Click "‚ö° Generate PowerShell"
- **Expected**: Opens a PowerShell script with:
  - `$headers` hashtable including `kbn-xsrf = "true"`
  - `Authorization = "ApiKey <key>"` format for Kibana
  - SSL certificate handling comments
  - Comprehensive error handling with response body capture
  - Parameter suggestions based on endpoint schema

#### 4d. Generate Python (Kibana-Enhanced)
- Click "üêç Generate Python"
- **Expected**: Opens Python code with:
  - `import requests`
  - Headers dictionary including `"kbn-xsrf": "true"`
  - `"Authorization": "ApiKey <key>"` for Kibana environments
  - Proper error handling

#### 4e. Generate JavaScript (Kibana-Enhanced)
- Click "üìú Generate JavaScript"
- **Expected**: Opens JavaScript code with:
  - `fetch()` API usage
  - Headers object including `"kbn-xsrf": "true"`
  - `"Authorization": "ApiKey <key>"` for Kibana environments
  - Promise-based error handling

#### 4f. Generate Ansible (Kibana-Enhanced)
- Click "üîß Generate Ansible"
- **Expected**: Opens YAML with:
  - `uri` module configuration
  - Headers section with `kbn-xsrf: "true"`
  - `Authorization: "ApiKey <key>"` for Kibana
  - Proper YAML formatting

#### 4g. Test Endpoint
- Click "üß™ Test Endpoint"
- **Expected**: Shows dialog "Test METHOD /path?" with "Test Now" button
- Click "Test Now"
- **Expected**: Shows "Endpoint testing coming soon! üöÄ" message

## Verification Checklist

### Tree View Structure ‚úÖ
- [ ] Endpoints show as expandable items (collapsed arrow ‚ñ∂)
- [ ] Expanding shows 7 action options
- [ ] Icons are properly displayed for each action
- [ ] Clicking actions opens appropriate documents

### Kibana Detection ‚úÖ
Test with environment containing "kibana" in name or URL:
- [ ] cURL includes `kbn-xsrf: true` header
- [ ] PowerShell includes `"kbn-xsrf" = "true"` in headers hashtable
- [ ] Python includes `"kbn-xsrf": "true"` in headers dict
- [ ] JavaScript includes `"kbn-xsrf": "true"` in headers object
- [ ] Ansible includes `kbn-xsrf: "true"` in headers section

### API Key Format ‚úÖ
For Kibana environments with API key auth:
- [ ] cURL uses `Authorization: ApiKey <key>`
- [ ] PowerShell uses `"Authorization" = "ApiKey <key>"`
- [ ] Python uses `"Authorization": "ApiKey <key>"`
- [ ] JavaScript uses `"Authorization": "ApiKey <key>"`
- [ ] Ansible uses `Authorization: "ApiKey <key>"`

### PowerShell Enhancements ‚úÖ
- [ ] Includes SSL certificate handling comments
- [ ] Has comprehensive error handling with WebException catching
- [ ] Captures and displays response body on errors
- [ ] Uses proper PowerShell formatting and conventions
- [ ] Includes parameter suggestions from endpoint schema

### Code Quality ‚úÖ
- [ ] All generated code is syntactically correct
- [ ] Proper language-specific formatting
- [ ] Appropriate comments and documentation
- [ ] Error handling in each language
- [ ] No compilation errors in extension

## Expected Results

### Before Enhancement
- Clicking endpoint showed full details immediately
- Basic code generation without Kibana-specific headers
- Simple PowerShell scripts without error handling

### After Enhancement
- Expandable tree structure with action menu
- Kibana-aware code generation across all formats
- Enhanced PowerShell with comprehensive error handling
- Professional, production-ready code output

## Troubleshooting

### If Tree View Doesn't Show Actions
1. Check that `tree-provider.ts` properly sets `TreeItemCollapsibleState.Collapsed`
2. Verify `getEndpointChildren()` returns action items
3. Confirm command registration in `extension.ts`

### If Kibana Headers Missing
1. Verify environment name/URL contains "kibana"
2. Check `isKibanaEnvironment()` function logic
3. Confirm header generation in each format function

### If Commands Don't Work
1. Check command registration in `extension.ts`
2. Verify command IDs match between tree provider and command registration
3. Check console for any runtime errors

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

The test is successful if:
1. ‚úÖ Tree view shows expandable endpoints with 7 actions each
2. ‚úÖ All code generators detect Kibana environments correctly
3. ‚úÖ Generated code includes `kbn-xsrf` headers for Kibana
4. ‚úÖ API key format uses `Authorization: ApiKey <key>` for Kibana
5. ‚úÖ PowerShell includes enhanced error handling and SSL options
6. ‚úÖ All generated code is syntactically correct and executable
7. ‚úÖ Extension compiles without errors
8. ‚úÖ User experience is significantly improved with organized actions
