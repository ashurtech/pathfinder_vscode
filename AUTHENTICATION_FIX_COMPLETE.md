# Authentication Details Fixed ✅

## Issue Resolved
**Phase 12**: Authentication details missing in environment creation

## Problem
The `addEnvironmentForSchemaHandler` function was only prompting for environment name and base URL, but was missing the authentication setup flow. This resulted in environments being created with `auth: { type: 'none' }` regardless of user needs.

## Root Cause
The function was incomplete - it was missing the authentication type selection and credential collection steps that were present in the original `addApiEnvironmentHandler`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Secret Storage Methods to ConfigurationManager
Added public methods to `configuration.ts`:
- `storeSecret(key: string, value: string)` - Store secrets securely
- `getSecret(key: string)` - Retrieve secrets
- `deleteSecret(key: string)` - Remove secrets

### 2. Enhanced Environment Creation Flow
Updated `addEnvironmentForSchemaHandler` in `extension.ts` to include:

**Authentication Type Selection:**
- No Authentication
- API Key (header or query parameter)
- Bearer Token
- Basic Authentication (username/password)

**Credential Collection & Storage:**
- API Key: Prompts for key, location (header/query), and parameter name
- Bearer Token: Prompts for token value
- Basic Auth: Prompts for username and password
- All secrets stored securely using VS Code's SecretStorage

**URL Validation:**
- Added proper URL validation with helpful error messages

## Testing Steps

1. **Launch Extension Development Host** (F5)
2. **Create Schema First** (if none exist)
3. **Right-click on Schema** → "Add Environment"
4. **Verify Full Flow:**
   - Environment name prompt ✅
   - Base URL prompt with validation ✅
   - Authentication type selection ✅
   - Credential prompts based on auth type ✅
   - Optional description prompt ✅
   - Environment saved with proper auth configuration ✅

## Expected Behavior Now

### When adding environment under a schema:
```
1. "Enter a name for this environment" → e.g., "Production API"
2. "Enter the base URL" → e.g., "https://api.example.com" (validated)
3. "Select authentication method" → Choice of 4 options
4. [If API Key] → Key, location, parameter name prompts
5. [If Bearer] → Token prompt
6. [If Basic] → Username and password prompts
7. [If None] → Skip to description
8. "Enter a description (optional)" → Optional description
9. Success: "✅ Environment 'Production API' has been saved!"
```

### Authentication Data Storage:
- Secrets stored securely in VS Code's SecretStorage
- Non-sensitive auth metadata stored in environment config
- Secret references stored as: `env:{environmentId}:apiKey`, `env:{environmentId}:bearerToken`, etc.

## Files Modified

1. **`src/configuration.ts`**:
   - Added `storeSecret()`, `getSecret()`, `deleteSecret()` methods

2. **`src/extension.ts`**:
   - Enhanced `addEnvironmentForSchemaHandler()` with complete auth flow
   - Added URL validation
   - Added all authentication type support

## Result

✅ **Complete authentication setup now working for schema environments**
✅ **Consistent experience with original environment creation**
✅ **Secure credential storage using VS Code SecretStorage**
✅ **All authentication types supported (none/apikey/bearer/basic)**
✅ **Extension successfully compiles and packages**

## Tree Structure Example
```
📂 Schema: "My API v1.0" (🔵 Blue)
├── ➕ Add Environment (NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL)
├── 📁 Add Environment Group  
├── ✏️ Edit Schema
├── 🎨 Change Schema Color
├── 🗑️ Delete Schema
└── 🖥️ Production Environment (🔵 Blue - with proper auth)
    ├── ✏️ Edit Environment
    ├── 📋 Duplicate Environment  
    └── 🗑️ Delete Environment
```

The schema-first architecture refactor is now **COMPLETE** with full authentication support! 🎉
